NOTES

Things Tectonics needs to do:

- Generate a CubeField of height/ruggedness based on the underlying plates.
- Get the height at any arbitrary point based on the CubeField values plus noise.
- Show tectonic plate boundaries for visualization/debugging purposes.
  - Maybe one mesh with thin lines for interior lines and thick ones for exterior ones?
  - Color the plate-boundary lines to indicate direction from each other.

Tectonics interface:

- heightAt(pos: THREE.Vector3)
- showPlates(show: boolean)
- destroy()

HeightCubeField interface:
  - Data: height, ruggedness
  - drawLine(start: THREE.Vector3, end: THREE.Vector3, height: number, ruggedness: number)
  - setCell(height: number, ruggedness: number)
  - nearnessToWater(cell: number)
    returns 0.0 -> 1.0 representing how many of the nearby cells (5x5 grid) are water vs. land.
    0.0 if they're all land, 1.0 if they're all water

Plate:
  - Data: number, direction, land vs. water

PlateBoundary:
  - Data: startPoint, endPoint, plateA, plateB, magnitude

PlateSphere interface:

- Data: plateBoundaries: PlateBoundary[]
- makeEdgesMesh(): THREE.LineSegments
- plateAtPoint(point: THREE.Vector3): Plate




To generate the HeightCubeField:
 - Create the starting heights of each cell
   - Land cells:
     - If within 100 km of a water cell, ranges between 1m to 90m
     - Otherwise, use noise to very gradually vary it between 90m and 600m.
   - Water cells:
     - If within 100 km of a land cell, ranges between -1m to -100m
     - Otherwise, use noise to very gradually vary it between -100m and -6,000m.

Variations for coastlines are dependent on how much coastline is near the given cell. Maybe check the

 - For each line segment
   - If it's a plate boundary
     - If they're colliding
       - If one cell is ocean and one is land
         - The ocean cell gets very little continental shelf
         - The land cell gets mountainous
       - If both are ocean
         - A trench forms along the boundary (counter-intuitive, I know!)
       - If both are land
         - An orogenous mountain range forms along the boundary
     - If they're heading apart
       - If one cell is ocean and one is land
         - The ocean cell gets a long continental shelf
         - The land cell gets flat
       - If both are ocean
         - Oceanic ridges form along the boundary, getting progressively smaller the further away they get
       - If both are land
         - Rift valleys form along the boundary

The height of a mountain range is dependent on the magnitude of the collision between two plates.
Low mountains may be high ruggedness (young) or low ruggedness (old). High mountains will be medium rugged.

Consider adding extra low-ruggedness mountain stripes inside plates to represent really old mountains like the
Appalachians whose plate collisions were too long ago to have happened at the current boundaries.

Later we'll want determine the type of rock (igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary, etc.) in this step as well, which will
come into play later when we're calculating groundwater capacity, erosion, etc. (Maybe soil depth as well.) That can get
a separate CubeField.
