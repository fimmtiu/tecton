TO DO

* Investigate Voronoi cells in 3D on a sphere
  - are there any existing libraries?

  https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1842-delaunay-voronoi-sphere/ : how to do Voronoi cells on a sphere
  https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator : JS library for fast Delaunay triangulation
  https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi : A library for doing EXACTLY THIS THING. BOOM.

* Texture isn't getting painted at the very bottom corners of the zoomed-in mesh, even though there are vertices there.
  Are we missing painting the bottom row or something?
